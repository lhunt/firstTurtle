''' QUESTIONS/MODIFICATIONS

    1.  How do you write in 'comments' for humans that will not be seen
    as code?
    
    2.  What are the 'variables' (what can be changed) in this program? 
    
    3.  Make a rectangular shape on the screen 
      
    4.  Create another turtle (with a different name) and make your new turtle move too

    5.  Play around with the commands forward, left, etc. and make a variety of shapes with
    your turtles.
    
    6.  Go to  https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/turtle.html which will give you
a whole bunch of information about turtles!!  Play around with some of the
methods you see and make a picture of your own.  We will do a 'gallery walk' to see your 
creation!

Formal Definitions:  
You just learned about objects (bob and alice),  methods (forward, left), and parameters (150, 90, 100, etc)
objects call on methods which take a parameter and perform something. For example, my turtle object bob
called on the method forward with a parameter of 150.  This made bob move forward 150 steps!
